Build system based on trolltech's tmake. Makes a vips.dll on win32.

Copy the .pro and Makefiles in this area into the main VIPS libsrc tree,
then either use the makefiles already there, (you'll need to edit them),
or install tmake and regenerate them from the .pro files.

	tmake todo.pro -o makefile_todo
	nmake -f makefile_todo tmake_all
	nmake -f makefile_todo all
	tmake vips.pro -o Makefile
	nmake -f Makefile all

You might need to edit the .pro files a little as well.
