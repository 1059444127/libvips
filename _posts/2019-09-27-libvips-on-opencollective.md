Thanks to work by Lovell, libvips is now [listed on
opencollective](https://opencollective.com/libvips).

The idea is to have some more formal way to accept donations. I think the
immediate idea is just to use any money to help pay for beer and/or pizza when
libvips developers meet up, but perhaps if more money comes in it could
help fund development.

We'll see!
