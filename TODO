- vips2bufpng() is leaky

- test rad read/write

- rad save should auto pack to CODING RAD

- test matio load

- radiance to go still

- saverawfd should be renamed saveraw_fd, cf. pngsave_buffer

- remove uses of vips_image_pio_output(), this is done for you by generate
  now

  do we need vips_image_wio_output()? can't vips_image_write_line() call this
  as well?

  we need it in case we write to the data pointer of a "t" image I guess

- magickload is broken

	$ vips magickload healthygirl.jpg x.v
	VipsRegion: inappropriate region type
	VipsRegion: inappropriate region type
	VipsImage: file has been truncated

  seems to be a magick bug: ping jpg reports 1 band, load jpg reports 3 band

  posted a question, wait for reply





- make the old format/vips.c into a stub as well?

  move format/* to deprecated




- how about

	vips max add[babe.jpg,babe2.jpg]

  does that make any sense?

	vips copy add[babe.jpg,add[babe2.jpg,babe3.jpg]] sum.v




- see vips_image_cache(): it currently writes to @out allocated by its caller

  should this be called vips_image_write_cache()? or wrapped in the style 
  of vips_copy()? 

- make an argb coding type, add to nip2 and known coding

- nip2 should use zooming support, if possible

- transform_g_string_array_image() can't handle quoted strings, so filenames
  with spaces will break

  is there an easy fix? can we reuse code from the csv parser?

  the csv parser just parses FILE* streams, we'd need to break it out




- test docs

  gtk-doc can't introspect to generate class docs since it has no way to init
  the classes ... investigate




- try an area operation, like conv, VipsArea? oops no haha what name should we
  use?



- test _O_TEMPORARY thing on Windows



- avg/dev etc. should uncode images? eg. labq2lab etc.

  how about ifthenelse? 








- bandalike: consider RGB + RGBA ... we should bandup by adding a black band

  (or white?? unclear)

  not clear if this is a good idea ... eg. when we upband a 1 band to a 2
  band, should we duplicate the 1 band or add black?




- note member free stuff in vipsobject docs

  should boxed get freed in finalise rather than dispose?

  vipsobject has few docs atm :(




- we have this is many places:

	if( vips_image_copy_fieldsv( conversion->output, 
		insert->main, insert->sub, NULL ) )
		return( -1 );
        vips_demand_hint( conversion->output, 
		VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_THINSTRIP, insert->main, insert->sub, NULL );

  why not combine these into a single API call?

  use array version in several places

  things like black and min (sources and sinks) only set the dhint




- vips_object_set_argument_from_string() needs more arg types

  must be some way to make this more automatic




- add nifti support

	http://niftilib.sourceforge.net/







- add vips_init_argv() which processes argc/argv for you? handy for tiny
  progs, perhaps

  just saves 5 lines of code, don't bother





- generate the code for vips_add() etc. automatically? it might be 
  nice to have them all in one place at least




- all the old dispatch wrappers could move to deprecated




- support planar tiff




- vips operation print could show operation flags as well, cf. "vips
  im_subtract"

  haha, we don't have any flags like that on operation ... NOCACHE looks
  useful, should we add that? any others?

  maybe wait until we have to




- revisit orc conv

  use an 8.8 accumulator ... build the scale into the 8.8 coeffs ... no div at
  the end, just a shift

  need 8 x 8.8 -> 8.8 for each coeff though







  



- make a vips8 binding for Python as well

  use ctypes and not swig so we get an easy Win version

  wrap new API for C++






- Magick: 

	- do we bundle "convert" in the OS X / win32 builds? if we don't we
	  should




- need vips_image_invalidate_area()






- add matlab write

- need a way to make the vips.1 etc. man pages

  gtk has things like docs/reference/gtk/gtk-update-icon-cache.xml and man
  pages are made from that with xslt

- get rid of a lot of the command-line programs, who wants to write a man page
  for batch_image_convert etc yuk

- can we make man pages for the API as well? probably not from googling a bit



- use g_mmap() or whatever it's called ... or perhaps they don't have all
  these options




- use |_O_TEMPORARY to open()'s mode on Windows for tmpfiles to increase the
  chances we actually delete

  see http://www.mail-archive.com/bug-gnulib@gnu.org/msg05730.html





- lab [100,0,0] -> srgb [255, 255, 254]? how odd









- im_conv()/im_morph() could have more than 10 programs? try 20 and see if we
  still have a speedup

  make a base class for vector area operations with a matrix with three vfuncs
  for init / generate code for one element / end and a gslist of programs, use
  that as the base for morph and conv

  wait for vipsobject for this




- perspective transform with a matrix ... base it on the Lenz transformer, but
  partial





- maybe im_draw_smudge() is too slow :-( also, we had a sanity failure with
  it, argh

  make a region, prepare to that, copy back over the image?




- use D65 in cmsCreateLab4Profile() ? not sure

- im_divide() can /0 for complex 




- test

		python setup.py build_ext
		python setup.py build
		python setup.py install

- convert_saveable for other writers: tiff, ppm, csv, rad etc.



- expose more of the tone funcs in nip2

- quite a few hist operations have no GUI ... lhisteq, for example? or
  histspec?




- rename header, edvips as vipsheader, vipsedit

  maybe have back compat links?

- should im_rwcheck() copy to disc?

  maybe im_rwcheck_disc() copies to im->filename and maps that

  rather awkward to do atm with the way check.c is structured

- what does G_UNLIKELY() do? can we use it?

- rename vipsCC in SWIG as pyvips?

- look into G_GNUC_DEPRECATED for back compat in vips8

- can we use conv_sep to speed up the memuse benchmarks?

- check mosaic1, global_balance, similarity etc. use of im__affine
  
  how can we move them to im_affinei ?

- doc strings would be nice, read the SWIG notes on this

- bilateral filtering, see:

	http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter
	http://www.shellandslate.com/fastmedian.html
	http://people.csail.mit.edu/sparis/bf_course/

  also a mail from Martin Breidt has links to several fast free C
  implementations

- need a section for vipsobject in the tutorial

  also a manpage?

  not really stable yet :( don't document

- we shouldn't need to call im_invalidate() in gtkdisp4 :( how can we fix
  this?

- we should wrap the format API, also im_render*(), see gtkdisp.cc for sample
  code

- need an im_init_world() for C++ which does cmd-line args too, so C++ progs
  can get --vips-progress and stuff automatically

- unsharp should work on GREY16? should be easy to add GREY16->LABS

  no, labs is signed short, ranges are all differrent, and the scaling will be
  wrong anyway

  correct: import with ICC to labs, then process, then export to RGB, take
  green?

  yuk, can we add a 16bit path to vips's lab <--> rgb converter?

  use TIFF RGB16 as the 16bit RGB target

  im_XYZ2disp() would be easy to 16bit ... just need the 1,500 element table
  table->t_Yr2r[i] expanded
  
  im_disp2XYZ() uses im_col_rgb2XYZ() in a loop ... again, need
  the 1,500 element table table->t_r2Yr[i] expanded

  usually these three tables (t_r2Yr, t_g2Yg, t_b2Yb) will be identical, can
  we common them up? same for t_Yr2r etc.

  how big should the table be for 16 bits? 256 times larger? too big!

  we really just need a LUT for pow() with the right exponent, eg. 2.4 for
  sRGBs, and one for 1/2.4 ... see what calcul_tables does:

  	table->t_r2Yr[i] = yo + a * pow( i * table->ristep / f + c, ga );

  see



  

- test maxpos_avg, quite a few changes

- HAVE_HYPOT could define a hypot() macro?

- im_exr2vips can now use c++ api

  see TODO notes in openexr read (though they all need more openexr C API)

  consider openexr write

- python startup fails with plugins in vipslib:

	Fatal Python error: can't initialise module vips
	plugin: unable to open plugin "/home/john/vips/lib/resample.plg"
	plugin: /home/john/vips/lib/resample.plg: undefined symbol: im_start_one

  do we need to build plugins with -rpath etc. and more libs?

  or do we need to make sure our python modules export all their im_ symbols?

  check:

  	http://www.swig.org/Doc1.3/SWIGDocumentation.html#Python_nn8
	http://docs.python.org/dist/dist.html
	result = vips_call ("name", args)

  then call that from VImage_method

- do we really need VImage_method? Can't we write

	__getattr__ (self, name) = lambda (obj_to_call, arguments):

  or something like that?

- TIFF load/save should use meta system for unknown tags

- balance should use new meta stuff

- magick2vips should spot ICC profiles and attach them as meta

- also png2vips?

- magick should set some header field for n_frames and frame_height? see also
  analyze

- im_csv2vips() could use "-" for filename to mean stdin

  but then we'd have to read to a malloced buffer of some sort rather than an
  image, since we might need to grow it during the read, since we couldn't
  then seek

- add erode/dilate 3x3 special case using a 512-bit LUT

  ... nope, actually slower :-( we end up doing an inner loop like

  	for( i = 0; i < 9; i++ )
		bits |= (p[o[i]] != 0) << i;

  which is horrible. Maybe if we had a one band true 1 bit image it'd be
  quicker since we could get bits out in parallel and wouldn't have to worry
  about converting non-zero to 1

  could have a Coding type for bitpack? eg. relational produces a bitpack
  image by default, boolean & morph can work on bitpack etc

  maybe something for vips8 ... we could have a flag on operations for the
  coding types they can accept, and if they are passed other type, they are
  automatically converted

- non-linear sharpen: replace each pixel by the lightest or darkest neighbour
  depending on which is closer in value

- can wrap other inplace funcs which use ink now we have vector_to_ink() in
  inplace_dispatch.c

  see also comments in nip2 TODO ... we could auto-wrap in vips_call.c

  cleaner!
