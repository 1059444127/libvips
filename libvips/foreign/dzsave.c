/* save to deep zoom format
 *
 * 21/3/12
 * 	- from the tiff pyramid writer
 * 5/7/12 (thanks Alexander Koshman)
 * 	- make tiles down to 1x1 pixels 
 *	- oop make right-hand edge tiles 
 *	- improve overlap handling 
 * 7/7/12
 * 	- threaded write
 * 6/8/12 (thanks to Benjamin Gilbert for pointing out the errors)
 * 	- shrink down to a 1x1 pixel tile, even for very long and thin images
 * 	- round image size up on shrink
 * 	- write a .dzi file with the pyramid params
 * 	- default tile size and overlap now matches the openslide writer
 * 7/8/12 (thanks to Benjamin Gilbert again for more testing)
 * 	- reorganise the directory structure
 * 	- rename to basename and tile_size
 * 	- deprecate tile_width/_height and dirname 
 * 1/10/12
 * 	- did not write low pyramid layers for images with an odd number of
 * 	  scan lines (thanks Martin)
 * 2/10/12
 * 	- remove filename options from format string in .dzi (thanks Martin)

/**
 * vips_dzsave:
 * @in: image to save 
 * @basename: basename to save to 
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Optional arguments:
 *
 * @suffix: suffix for tile tiles (default ".jpg")
 * @overlap; set tile overlap (default 1)
 * @tile_size; set tile size (default 256)
 *
 * Save an image to a deep zoom - style directory tree. A directory called
 * "@basename_files" is created to hold the tiles, and an XML file called
 * "@basename.dzi" is written with the image metadata,
 *
 * The image is shrunk in a series of x2 reductions until it fits within a
 * single pixel. Each layer is written out to a separate subdirectory of 
 * @dirname_files, with directory "0" holding the smallest, single pixel image.
 *
 * Each tile is written as a separate file named as "@x_@y@suffix", where @x
 * and @y are the tile coordinates, with (0, 0) as the top-left tile.
 *
 * You can set @suffix to something like ".jpg[Q=85]" to set the tile write
 * options. 
 *
 * See also: vips_tiffsave().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
