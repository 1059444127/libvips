/**
 * vips_tiffsave:
 * @in: image to save 
 * @filename: file to write to 
 * @compression; use this compression scheme
 * @Q: quality factor
 * @predictor; compress with this prediction
 * @profile: attach this ICC profile
 * @tile; set %TRUE to write a tiled tiff
 * @tile_width; set tile size
 * @tile_height; set tile size
 * @pyramid; set %TRUE to write an image pyramid
 * @squash; squash 8-bit images down to 1 bit
 * @resunit; use pixels per inch or cm for the resolution
 * @xres; horizontal resolution
 * @yres; vertical resolution
 * @bigtiff; write a BigTiff file
 * @...: %NULL-terminated list of optional named arguments
 *
 * Write a VIPS image to a file as TIFF.
 *
 * Use @compression to set the tiff compression. Currently jpeg, packbits,
 * fax4, lzw, none and deflate are supported. The default is no compression.
 * JPEG compression is a good lossy compressor for photographs, packbits is 
 * good for 1-bit images, and deflate is the best lossless compression TIFF 
 * can do. LZW has patent problems and is no longer recommended.
 *
 * Use @Q to set the JPEG compression factor. Default 75.
 *
 * Use @predictor to set the predictor for lzw and deflate compression. 
 *
 * Predictor is not set by default. There are three predictor values recognised
 * at the moment (2007, July): 1 is no prediction, 2 is a horizontal 
 * differencing and 3 is a floating point predictor. Refer to the libtiff 
 * specifications for further discussion of various predictors. In short, 
 * predictor helps to better compress image, especially in case of digital 
 * photos or scanned images and bit depths > 8. Try it to find whether it 
 * works for your images.
 *
 * Use @profile to give the filename of a profile to be embedded in the TIFF.
 * This does not affect the pixels which are written, just the way 
 * they are tagged. You can use the special string "none" to mean 
 * "don't attach a profile".
 *
 * If no profile is specified and the VIPS header 
 * contains an ICC profile named VIPS_META_ICC_NAME ("icc-profile-data"), the
 * profile from the VIPS header will be attached.
 *
 * Set @tile to TRUE to write a tiled tiff.  By default tiff are written in
 * strips. Use @tile_width and @tile_height to set the tile size. The defaiult
 * is 128 by 128.
 *
 * Set @pyramid to write the image as a set of images, one per page, of
 * decreasing size. 
 *
 * Set @squash to make 8-bit uchar images write as 1-bit TIFFs with zero
 * pixels written as 0 and non-zero as 1.
 *
 * Use @resunit to override the default resolution unit.  
 * The default 
 * resolution unit is taken from the header field "resolution-unit"
 * (#VIPS_META_RESOLUTION_UNIT in C). If this field is not set, then 
 * VIPS defaults to cm.
 *
 * Use @xres and @yres to override the default horizontal and vertical
 * resolutions. By default these values are taken from the VIPS image header. 
 *
 * Set @bigtiff to attempt to write a bigtiff. 
 * Bigtiff is a variant of the TIFF
 * format that allows more than 4GB in a file.
 *
 * See also: vips_tiffload(), vips_image_write_file().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error.
