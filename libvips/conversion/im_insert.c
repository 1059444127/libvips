/**
 * im_insertset:
 * @main: big image
 * @sub: small image
 * @out: output image
 * @n: number of positions
 * @x: left positions of @sub
 * @y: top positions of @sub
 *
 * Insert @sub repeatedly into @main at the positions listed in the arrays @x,
 * @y of length @n. @out is the same
 * size as @main. @sub is clipped against the edges of @main. 
 *
 * This operation is fast for large @n, but will use a memory buffer the size
 * of @out. It's useful for things like making scatter plots.
 *
 * If the number of bands differs, one of the images 
 * must have one band. In this case, an n-band image is formed from the 
 * one-band image by joining n copies of the one-band image together, and then
 * the two n-band images are operated upon.
 *
 * The two input images are cast up to the smallest common type (see table 
 * Smallest common format in 
 * <link linkend="VIPS-arithmetic">arithmetic</link>).
 *
 * See also: im_insert(), im_lrjoin().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, -1 on error
