 * the type of region geometry this operation works best with. For example,
 * operations which transform coordinates will usually work best with
 * %IM_SMALLTILE, operations which work on local windows of pixels will like
 * %IM_FATSTRIP.
 *
 * VIPS uses the list of input images to build the tree of operations it needs
 * for the cache invalidation system. You have to call this function, or its
 * varargs friend im_demand_hint().
 *
 * See also: im_demand_hint(), im_generate().
 *
 * Returns: 0 on success, or -1 on error.
