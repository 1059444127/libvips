/** 
 * VipsDemandStyle:
 * @VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_SMALLTILE: demand in small (typically 64x64 pixel) tiles
 * @VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_FATSTRIP: demand in fat (typically 10 pixel high) strips
 * @VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_THINSTRIP: demand in thin (typically 1 pixel high) strips
 * @VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_ANY: demand geometry does not matter
 *
 * See im_demand_hint(). Operations can hint to the VIPS image IO system about
 * the kind of demand geometry they prefer. 
 *
 * These demand styles are given below in order of increasing
 * restrictiveness.  When demanding output from a pipeline, im_generate()
 * will use the most restrictive of the styles requested by the operations 
 * in the pipeline.
 *
 * VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_THINSTRIP --- This operation would like to output strips 
 * the width of the image and a few pels high. This is option suitable for 
 * point-to-point operations, such as those in the arithmetic package.
 *
 * This option is only efficient for cases where each output pel depends 
 * upon the pel in the corresponding position in the input image.
 *
 * VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_FATSTRIP --- This operation would like to output strips 
 * the width of the image and as high as possible. This option is suitable 
 * for area operations which do not violently transform coordinates, such 
 * as im_conv(). 
 *
 * VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_SMALLTILE --- This is the most general demand format.
 * Output is demanded in small (around 100x100 pel) sections. This style works 
 * reasonably efficiently, even for bizzare operations like 45 degree rotate.
 *
 * VIPS_DEMAND_STYLE_ANY --- This image is not being demand-read from a disc 
 * file (even indirectly) so any demand style is OK. It's used for things like
 * im_black() where the pixels are calculated.
 *
 * See also: vips_demand_hint().

/**
 * VipsInterpretation: 
 * @VIPS_TYPE_MULTIBAND: generic many-band image
 * @VIPS_TYPE_B_W: some kind of single-band image
 * @VIPS_TYPE_HISTOGRAM: a 1D image such as a histogram or lookup table
 * @VIPS_TYPE_FOURIER: image is in fourier space
 * @VIPS_TYPE_XYZ: the first three bands are colours in CIE XYZ colourspace
 * @VIPS_TYPE_LAB: pixels are in CIE Lab space
 * @VIPS_TYPE_CMYK: the first four bands are in CMYK space
 * @VIPS_TYPE_LABQ: implies #VIPS_CODING_LABQ
 * @VIPS_TYPE_RGB: generic RGB space
 * @VIPS_TYPE_UCS: a uniform colourspace based on CMC
 * @VIPS_TYPE_LCH: pixels are in CIE LCh space
 * @VIPS_TYPE_LABS: pixels are CIE LAB coded as three signed 16-bit values
 * @VIPS_TYPE_sRGB: pixels are sRGB
 * @VIPS_TYPE_YXY: pixels are CIE Yxy
 * @VIPS_TYPE_RGB16: generic 16-bit RGB
 * @VIPS_TYPE_GREY16: generic 16-bit mono
 *
 * How the values in an image should be interpreted. For example, a
 * three-band float image of type #VIPS_TYPE_LAB should have its pixels
 * interpreted as coordinates in CIE Lab space.
 *
 * These values are set by operations as hints to user-interfaces built on top 
 * of VIPS to help them show images to the user in a meaningful way. 
 * Operations do not use these values to decide their action.
