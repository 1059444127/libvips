/*
 * John: This is the version which I think you should base the code
 * for signed and unsigned ints, floats and doubles. IN_AND_OUT_TYPE
 * stands for the "input" and "output" types. The computation is
 * performed based on doubles (even for float data). There is a reason
 * for this, which is that I use implicit casts of flag variables into
 * ints into doubles, and I think that such casts may be slower from
 * ints to floats.
 *
 * IMPORTANT: Because nohalo is monotone, there is no need to clamp,
 * ever.
 *
 * I have inserted code which I hope does fairly quick rounding to
 * nearest when signed or unsigned ints are used. Look for the word
 * "John".
 *
 * Set the LGPL license to what you like. As long as my name is
 * suitably inserted, I don't care about the exact license.

/*
 * ================
 * NOHALO RESAMPLER
 * ================
 *
 * "Nohalo" is a family of parameterized resamplers with a mission:
 * smoothly straightening oblique lines without undesirable
 * side-effects.
 *
 * The key parameter, which may be described as a "quality" parameter,
 * is an integer which specifies the number of "levels" of binary
 * subdivision which are performed. If level = 0 can be thought of as
 * being plain vanilla bilinear resampling; level = 1 is the first
 * "non-classical" method.
 *
 * Besides increasing computational cost, increasing the number of
 * levels increases the quality of the resampled pixel value unless
 * the resampled location happens to be exactly where a subdivided
 * grid point (for this level) is located, in which case further
 * levels do not change the answer, and consequently do not increase
 * its quality.
 *
 * ============================================================
 * WARNING: THIS CODE ONLY IMPLEMENTS THE LOWEST QUALITY NOHALO
 * ============================================================
 * 
 * This code implement nohalo for (quality) level = 1.  Nohalo for
 * higher quality levels will be implemented later.
 *
 * Key properties:
 *
 * =======================
 * Nohalo is interpolatory
 * =======================
 *
 * That is, nohalo preserves point values: If asked for the value at
 * the center of an input pixel, the sampler returns the corresponding
 * value, unchanged. In addition, because nohalo is continuous, if
 * asked for a value at a location "very close" to the center of an
 * input pixel, then the sampler returns a value "very close" to
 * it. (Nohalo is not smoothing like, say, B-Spline
 * pseudo-interpolation.)
 *
 * ========================================================
 * Nohalo is co-monotone (this is why it's called "nohalo")
 * ========================================================
 *
 * What monotonicity means here is that the resampled value is in the
 * range of the four closest input values. Consequently, nohalo does
 * not add haloing. It also means that clamping is unnecessary
 * (provided abyss values are within the range of acceptable values,
 * which is always the case). (Note: plain vanilla bilinear is also
 * co-monotone.)
 *
 * Note: If the abyss policy is an extrapolating one---for example,
 * linear or bilinear extrapolation---clamping is still unnecessary
 * unless one attempts to resample outside of the convex hull of the
 * input pixel positions. Consequence: the "corner" image size
 * convention does not require clamping when using linear
 * extrapolation abyss policy when performing image resizing, but the
 * "center" one does, when upscaling, at locations very close to the
 * boundary. If computing values at locations outside of the convex
 * hull of the pixel locations of the input image, nearest neighbour
 * abyss policy is most likely better anyway, because linear
 * extrapolation produces "streaks" if positions far outside the
 * original image boundary are resampled.
 *
 * ========================
 * Nohalo is a local method
 * ========================
 *
 * The value of the reconstructed intensity surface at any point
 * depends on the values of (at most) 12 nearby input values, located
 * in a "cross" centered at the closest four input pixel centers. For
 * computational expediency, the input values corresponding to the
 * nearest 21 input pixel locations (5x5 minus the four corners)
 * should be made available through a data pointer. The code then
 * selects the needed ones from this enlarged stencil.
 *
 * ===========================================================
 * When level = infinity, nohalo's intensity surface is smooth
 * ===========================================================
 *
 * It is conjectured that the intensity surface is infinitely
 * differentiable. Consequently, "Mach banding" (primarily caused by
 * sharp "ridges" in the reconstructed intensity surface and
 * particularly noticeable, for example, when using bilinear
 * resampling) is (essentially) absent, even at high magnifications,
 * WHEN THE LEVEL IS HIGH (more or less when 2^(level+1) is at least
 * the largest local magnification factor, which means that the level
 * 1 nohalo does not show much Mach banding up to a magnification of
 * about 4).
 *
 * ===============================
 * Nohalo is second order accurate
 * ===============================
 *
 * (Except possibly near the boundary: it is easy to make this
 * property carry over everywhere but this requires a tuned abyss
 * policy or building the boundary conditions inside the sampler.)
 * Nohalo is exact on linear intensity profiles, meaning that if the
 * input pixel values (in the stencil) are obtained from a function of
 * the form f(x,y) = a + b*x + c*y (a, b, c constants), then the
 * computed pixel value is exactly the value of f(x,y) at the
 * asked-for sampling location.
 *
 * ===================
 * Nohalo is nonlinear
 * ===================
 *
 * In particular, resampling a sum of images may not be the same as
 * summing the resamples (this occurs even without taking into account
 * over and underflow issues: images can only take values within a
 * banded range, and consequently no sampler is truly linear.)
 *
 * ====================
 * Weaknesses of nohalo
 * ====================
 *
 * In some cases, the first level nonlinear computation is wasted:
 *
 * If a region is bichromatic, the nonlinear component of the level 1
 * nohalo is zero in the interior of the region, and consequently
 * nohalo boils down to bilinear. For such images, either stick to
 * bilinear, or use a higher level (quality) setting. (There is no
 * real harm in using nohalo when it boils down to bilinear if one
 * does not mind wasting cycles.)
 *
 * Low quality levels do NOT produce a continuously differentiable
 * intensity surface:
 *
 * With a "finite" level is used (that is, in practice), the nohalo
 * intensity surface is only continuous: there are gradient
 * discontinuities because the "final interpolation step" is performed
 * with bilinear. (Exception: if the "corner" image size convention is
 * used and the magnification factor is 2, that is, if the resampled
 * points sit exactly on the binary subdivided grid, then nohalo level
 * 1 gives the same result as as level=infinity, and consequently the
 * intensity surface can be treated as if smooth.)
